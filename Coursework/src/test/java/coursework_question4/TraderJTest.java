/**

The Auctioneer class represents an auctioneer in an auction system.
It maintains a list of cars that are for sale, a list of sold cars,
and a list of unsold cars. An auctioneer also has the ability to check if a
specific car is available for sale, place an offer on a car, end a sale of a car,
and display the list of sold cars and unsold cars.
